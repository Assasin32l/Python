    Added:
        1. Tokenisation:
            - Converts a mathematical expression into a list of tokens.
            - Handles numbers, operators, parentheses, constants (e, pi), and functions (sqrt, sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan).
            - Supports negative numbers, including those enclosed in parentheses.
    
        2. Term Validation:
            - Validates the tokenized term to ensure it is a valid mathematical expression.
            - Checks for proper placement of operators, functions, and parentheses.
    
        3. Infix to Postfix Conversion:
            - Converts the tokenized infix expression to postfix notation using the Shunting Yard algorithm.
            - Handles operator precedence and associativity.
            - Supports functions and constants.
    
        4. Postfix Evaluation:
            - Evaluates the postfix expression to compute the result.
            - Supports arithmetic operations, functions, and constants.

        5. Tutorial:
            - Provides a tutorial on how to use the calculator.
            - Explains the supported numbers, operators, functions, constants, and parentheses.
            - Includes example expressions.
    
        6. Main Menu:
            - Displays a main menu with options to calculate, view history, view the tutorial, or quit.
            - Handles user input to navigate the menu.
    
        7. Calculation:
            - Prompts the user to enter a mathematical expression.
            - Tokenizes, validates, converts to postfix, and evaluates the expression.
            - Displays the result of the calculation.
            - Adds the calculation to the history.
    
        8. History:
            - Maintains a history of the last 10 calculations.
            - Displays the history upon user request.
    
        9. Quit:
            - Allows the user to quit the program from the main menu.
